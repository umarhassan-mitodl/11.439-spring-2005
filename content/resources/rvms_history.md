description: Roslindale, MA originally part of Roxbury and then West Roxbury was established
  in 1870.  During the 1950?s and 1960?s it had a thriving commercial district (2
  supermarkets, a movie theater, department store, etc.). During the mid 1970?s the
  commercial district saw a major decline due to the desegregation of the schools
  and subsequent flight of people to the suburbs and the growth of shopping malls.
  This decline continued for over 15 years. The commercial district during that time
  was empty storefronts and burned out buildings. Seventy-five percent of the commercial
  spaces were vacant. The businesses that managed to stay in the district were completely
  grated. There was virtually no foot traffic.
