description: 'The given outline is a guide for thinking about organizing and presenting
  your initial assessment and a proposed planning agenda for each District.  Your
  assessment can and should integrate prior studies, research and data on the districts,
  your conversations with key stakeholders (names provided to you by each Main Street
  manager) and your initial physical survey of the district.

  The outline has four key components: existing conditions; local visions and goals;
  implications for the planning agenda; and proposed planning agenda items.  While
  we will use class discussion to articulate and expand upon these latter two items,
  your thinking and recommendations in these two areas will initiate and advance the
  discussion.'
