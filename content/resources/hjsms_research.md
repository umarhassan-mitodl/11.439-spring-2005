description: 'HJSMS has done a significant amount of research on the commercial district.
  We would like the MIT class to help us figure out how to take the work we have done
  to the next level. There are four main areas that we would like the class to explore:
  1) What role for HJSMS in the two major developments in the district?, 2) How do
  we enhance the Restaurant Cluster?, 3) How do we further pursue the idea that Hyde/Jackson
  is a Latino oriented district (ie, ?The Heart of Latino Life in Boston??, 4) Anecdotal
  evidence suggests that sales in the district are down. Why is that? And what is
  the best way to turn that situation around?, and 5) What should be the role and
  agenda of the design committee?'
