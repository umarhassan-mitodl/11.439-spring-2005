description: 'After decades of decline, cities are rebounding, and one key to bringing
  urban areas back to life is revitalizing commercial districts. There are different
  approaches to doing that, a lot of challenges, and not a lot of ?how-to? books.
  This report draws on the existing literature on the revitalization of inner-city
  commercial districts to examine alternative approaches ? including the popular Main
  Street strategy ? and identify best practices.

  Because there is limited literature that focuses exclusively on inner-city commercial
  districts, the report draws selectively from a more extensive base of research that
  encompasses inner-city neighborhood revitalization, neighborhood economic development,
  and downtown development. This is the second of four reports in a study, funded
  by the Fannie Mae Foundation, on the use of the Main Street approach to revitalize
  inner-city business districts.'
